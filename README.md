# What does it do?
(Originally created by TempSafeGuard, but I have since lost contact with them because they have deleted their account.)


It's a simple Reddit bot, it comments on every new submission. If the comment gets to a certain score or below, a message linking to the post will be sent to the ModMail. The bot will constantly check the new queue and the list of comments. all comments are saved to a local database.

# How do I install it?
1) Download this repo.
2) Install the requirements detailed in requirements.txt.
3) Add your account details in the related fields.
4) Run it (it will automatically create a database).

# WARNING
I am still a beginner with Python. This code is messy and may not function 100% correctly. Please start an issue or a pull request if you wish to help.


Please be careful if you use this on a live SubReddit. The bot is experimental and may not work fully. Try on a test SubReddit first.
